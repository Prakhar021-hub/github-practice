# Machine learning algorithms 

This repository contains my hands-on practice code for various machine learning algorithms. It includes both *from-scratch implementations* and *library-based solutions* using scikit-learn, NumPy, and pandas, seaborn, matplotlib etc.

## Algorithms Covered [Supervised/Unsupervised]

- *Linear Regression* (with and without scikit-learn)
- *Logistic Regression*
- *Decision Trees*
- *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*
- *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*
- *Naive Bayes*
- *K-Means Clustering*
- *PCA (Principal Component Analysis)*
- *Random Forest*
